# Triangle with Angle

You're given the three angles a, b, and c respectively. Now check if these three angles can form a valid triangle with an area greater than 0 or not. Print "YES"(without quotes) if it can form a valid triangle with an area greater than 0, otherwise print "NO" (without quotes).

Input:

First-line will contain three numbers a, b, and c separated by space.

Output:

Print "YES"(without quotes) if these sides can form a valid triangle, otherwise print "NO" (without quotes).

Constraints
&nbsp; 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 180

Sample Input 1:
20 40 120

Sample Output 1:
YES

<br>

Sample Input 2:
100 18 42

Sample Output 2:
NO

<br>

EXPLANATION:

In the first example, angles set (20, 40, 120) can form a triangle with an area greater than 0.

In the second example, angles set (100, 18, 42) will never form a valid triangle.
