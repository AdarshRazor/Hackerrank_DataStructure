# Valid Triangle or not

You're given the length of three sides a, b, and c respectively. Now check if these three sides can form a triangle or not. Print "YES"(without quotes) if it can form a valid triangle with an area greater than 0, otherwise print "NO" (without quotes).

Input:
First-line will contain three numbers a, b, and c separated by space.

<br>

Output:
Print "YES"(without quotes) if these sides can form a valid triangle, otherwise print "NO" (without quotes).

Constraints
&nbsp; 1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 106

<br>

Sample Input 1:
2 4 3

Sample Output 1:
YES

<br>

Sample Input 2:
1 1 4

Sample Output 2:
NO

<br>

EXPLANATION:

In the first example, (2, 4, 3) can form a triangle with an area greater than 0.

In the second example, (1, 1, 4) will never form a valid triangle.
