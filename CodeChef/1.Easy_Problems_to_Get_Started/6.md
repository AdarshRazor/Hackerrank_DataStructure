Constraints
&nbsp; 1 ≤ N ≤ 106

Sample Input 1:
60

YES

<br>

Sample Input 2:
16

Sample Output 2:
NO

<br>

Sample Input 3:

EXPLANATION:
In the first example, 60 is divisible by 5 and 6 both, so he can take the bus.
In the second example, 16 is divisible by neither 5 nor 6, so he can't take the bus.
In the third example, 20 is divisible by 5, so he can take the bus.
