# Linked List

* Linear Data Structure
* Elements are stored as per memory availability
* Can access elements randomly using index
* Stores homogeneous elements i.e, similar elements
* Dynamic in size
* Easy to insert and delete elements
* Starting element or node is the key which is generally termed as head.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

* Advantages of Linked List:
    * Dynamic in size
    * No wastage of memory and size is always equal.
    * Easy to insert and delete elements.
    * Efficient memory allocation.
* Disadvantages of Linked List:
    * Random access is not possible.
    * If head is deleted, then entire list is lost.
* Applications of Linked List:

## Implementation

```C
#include <stdio.h>
int main(){
    //array declaration
    int name;
    int phone[10];

    //taking input
    printf("Enter the name: ");
    for(int i=0; i<10; i++){
        scanf("%d", &phone[i]);
    }

    //printing output
    printf("Name: %d\n", name);
    printf("Phone: ");
    for(int i=0; i<10; i++){
        printf("%d ", phone[i]);
    }
}
```

Input:<br>
10 9 8 7 6<br>
87 29 8 57 91<br><br>
Output:<br>
10 9 8 7 6<br>
87 29 8 57 91
